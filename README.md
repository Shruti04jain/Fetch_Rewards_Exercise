# Fetch_Rewards_Exercise

First: Review Existing Unstructured Data and Diagram a New Structured Relational Data Model
The first part of the exercise, to convert the unstructured json files to structured data was done in the notebook(FETCH REWARDS EXERCISE.ipynb) as well
and I have included a diagram with the new structured ER diagram(E-R Diagram.pdf)

Second: Write a query that directly answers a predetermined question from a business stakeholder.
I have covered some bullet points of a query using pandasql library.

Third: Evaluate Data Quality Issues in the Data Provided
Evaluated the Data Quality Issues using python (missing/null values)

Fourth: Communicate with Stakeholders
Constructed an email that is understandable to a product or business leader and saved it as Communicate_with_Stakeholders.txt
